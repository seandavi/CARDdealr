Description: For researchers and administrators trying to understand and 
  describe the populations they represent or work with, a necessary and
  often challenging first step is to identify and then access data. 
  This package provides a ready-to-
  use catalog of functions that access high-value epidiomiology and public
  health datasets. While the package caters to cancer population
  health and NCI Cancer Center data science needs, the data resources are 
  likely of general use to anyone doing this type of work in any field.
